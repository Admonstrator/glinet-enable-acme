## 📖 About

The `enable-acme.sh` script enables the Automated Certificate Management Environment (ACME) for GL.iNet routers. It automatically requests a Let's Encrypt certificate for your router's DDNS domain and configures nginx to use it, providing secure HTTPS access to your router's web interface.

Created by [Admon](https://forum.gl-inet.com/u/admon/) for the GL.iNet community.

> 🎖️ **Community Maintained** – Part of the [GL.iNet Toolbox](https://github.com/Admonstrator/glinet-toolbox) project  
> ⚠️ **Independent Project** – Not officially affiliated with GL.iNet or Let's Encrypt

---

## ✨ Features

- 🔒 **Automatic SSL/TLS Certificates** – Requests and installs Let's Encrypt certificates
- 🔄 **Auto-Renewal** – Certificates renew automatically via cron job
- 🌐 **DDNS Integration** – Works seamlessly with GL.iNet DDNS
- ⚙️ **Nginx Configuration** – Automatically configures nginx for HTTPS
- ✅ **Validation Checks** – Verifies DDNS and public IP match before proceeding
- 🕐 **Daily Checks** – Renewal cron job runs daily at 00:00
- 💾 **Persistence** – Optional: Make installation persistent across firmware upgrades
- 🔧 **Restore Function** – Easy restoration to factory default configuration
- 🤖 **Unattended Mode** – Support for automated installations with --force flag

## 📋 Requirements

| Requirement  | Details                                                    |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Router**   | GL.iNet router with latest firmware version                |
| **Internet** | Working internet connection                                |
| **DDNS**     | DDNS must be enabled and configured                        |
| **IP Match** | DDNS IP must match router's public IP (verified by script) |

> ⚠️ **Note:** VPN IP addresses are not supported. The certificate is issued for the router's public IP.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

Run the script without cloning the repository:

```bash
wget -O enable-acme.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Admonstrator/glinet-enable-acme/main/enable-acme.sh && sh enable-acme.sh
```

Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the ACME setup.

---

## 📚 Usage

### Installation Steps

1. Download the script onto the router (or use the Quick Start command above)
2. Open an SSH connection to the router
3. Navigate to the directory where the script is located
4. Execute the script:

```bash
sh enable-acme.sh
```

5. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the ACME process

### Persistence Across Firmware Updates

During installation, you'll be asked if you want to make the installation permanent. If you choose "yes", the certificate files and nginx configuration will be preserved during firmware upgrades by adding them to `/etc/sysupgrade.conf`.

This means:
- ✅ Your ACME certificates survive firmware updates
- ✅ Nginx configuration is preserved
- ✅ No need to reinstall after upgrading

### Manual Certificate Renewal

While certificates renew automatically, you can manually trigger renewal:

```bash
sh enable-acme.sh --renew
```

Or if you installed the script to `/usr/bin`:

```bash
/usr/bin/enable-acme --renew
```

---

## 🎛️ Command Line Options

The `enable-acme.sh` script supports the following options:

| Option      | Description                                                 |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--renew`   | Manually renew the ACME certificate                         |
| `--restore` | Restore nginx to factory default configuration              |
| `--force`   | Skip all confirmation prompts (for unattended installation) |
| `--log`     | Show timestamps in log messages                             |
| `--ascii`   | Use ASCII characters instead of emojis                      |
| `--help`    | Display help message                                        |

### Usage Examples

**Standard Installation:**
```bash
sh enable-acme.sh
```

**Unattended Installation (no prompts):**
```bash
sh enable-acme.sh --force
```

**Renew Certificate:**
```bash
sh enable-acme.sh --renew
```

**Restore to Factory Default:**
```bash
sh enable-acme.sh --restore
```

**ASCII Mode (for older terminals):**
```bash
sh enable-acme.sh --ascii
```

**With Timestamps:**
```bash
sh enable-acme.sh --log
```

## 🔄 Automatic Renewal

The certificate will be renewed automatically by a cron job installed by the script. The cron job checks for renewal every day at 00:00.

No manual intervention is required – just let it run!

---

## ⚙️ Restoring Factory Configuration

To restore the nginx configuration to factory default and remove ACME certificates, use the built-in restore function:

```bash
sh enable-acme.sh --restore
```

This will:
- ✅ Restore HTTP access on port 80
- ✅ Revert to self-signed certificates
- ✅ Remove ACME firewall rules
- ✅ Remove ACME configuration
- ✅ Remove renewal cron job
- ✅ Clean up sysupgrade.conf entries
- ✅ Restart nginx

You can also manually revert the changes with these commands:

```bash
sed -i 's/#listen 80;/listen 80;/g' /etc/nginx/conf.d/gl.conf
sed -i 's/#listen \[::\]:80;/listen \[::\]:80;/g' /etc/nginx/conf.d/gl.conf
sed -i 's|ssl_certificate .*;|ssl_certificate /etc/nginx/nginx.cer;|g' /etc/nginx/conf.d/gl.conf
sed -i 's|ssl_certificate_key .*;|ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/nginx.key;|g' /etc/nginx/conf.d/gl.conf
/etc/init.d/nginx restart
```
